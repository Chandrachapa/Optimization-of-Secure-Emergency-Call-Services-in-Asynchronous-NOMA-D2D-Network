This paper investigates the issue of improving se-
crecy capacity of device-to-device (D2D) communications in dis-
aster scenarios under the presence of jammers in close proximity.
Furthermore, an asynchronous-non orthogonal multiple access
(A-NOMA) assisted transmission scheme is considered due to
the resource limitations and the asynchrony in signal receptions
in out-of-coverage D2D scenarios. A binary optimization problem
is proposed to select the optimal data which enhances the sum
secrecy capacity of the transmissions. The results show that the
proposed optimized scheme outperforms the conventional secrecy
capacity.
